# Public API Playground

## Github Free API Link
Link - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

## Overview
This is a Python application that dives into the vast list of Free APIs found on github. I found that some of the APIs lacked examples of usage so I wanted to see what kind of information is attainable from said APIs.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/free-api-playground.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd free-api-playground
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## How to Use
1. Uncomment the sections of code you want to run in main.py.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for any user inputs.

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. Requests library (install with pip install requests)

## Customization
Feel free to customize the application by tinkering with the different endpoints. You can use the github link at the top of the application to navigate to your desired API. From there feel free to take a look at what is offered. You can use this application as an example of how some information can be attained via the free APIs.
